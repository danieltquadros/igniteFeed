# FEED OF POSTS AND COMMENTS

Project 01 of Rocketseat's Ignite course. Excellent project to start the course, as it works with the basic fundamentals of React.
It's always good to review some technologies we've already worked on and have the opportunity to further consolidate the concepts of each one of them.

THE PROJECT:

This project proposes to create a dynamic and responsive page that simulates a social network where the user's profile, posts and post comments appear.
The system also allows adding and removing comments.
